[live site at bradleysmith.tech](https://bradleysmith.tech)

My professional portfolio's source code. Built using Vue.js 3, Vue
Router, and SASS.

Namecheap handles the domain name, and Netlify hosts the live site. Netlify also
handles form submisssions, which triggers a service on Zappier to send the form
submisssion to my email account.
